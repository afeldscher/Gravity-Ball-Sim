# Gravity-Ball-Sim
  This is a 2D physics simulation java applet. To run the program, open the dist folder and click on the .jar file. Then click view raw to download the file. It does not need to install, it will simply run right from the file. (java must already be installed)
  
  In the program there is a red ball on a black background, simply click on the ball and drag it around and  drop it, throw it, or bounce it. (If you throw it too hard at the ground it may take a very long time to come back down.)
  
  It is the second version of the project and all of the features have not been fully 
added back in yet. Currently the program is set to emulate a total height of 8 meters with earth gravity. Later options will be added
to adjust this, along with velocity displays and graphs.
