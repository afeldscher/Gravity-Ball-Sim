# Gravity-Ball-Sim
  This is a 2D physics simulation java applet. It is the second version of the project and all of the features have not been fully 
added back in yet. Currently the program is set to emulate a total height of 8 meters with earth gravity. Later options will be added
to adjust this, along with velocity displays and graphs.
